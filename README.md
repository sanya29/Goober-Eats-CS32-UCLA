# Goober-Eats-CS32-UCLA
As the name suggests, it behaves like Uber Eats. It processes a list of deliveries in no particular order around Westwood, Los Angeles and optimizes (1) the order of deliveries such that the time between successive deliveries is minimized, and (2) the shortest route between the already optimized delivery points.
