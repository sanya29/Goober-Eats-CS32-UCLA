# Goober-Eats-CS32-UCLA
As the name suggests, the program processes a list of deliveries around Westwood, Los Angeles and, with the concept of Simulated Annealing, optimizes 
* the order of deliveries such that the time between successive deliveries is minimized, and 
* the shortest route between the already optimized delivery points
