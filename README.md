# Goober-Eats-CS32-UCLA
As the name suggests, it behaves like Uber Eats. It processes a list of deliveries around Westwood, Los Angeles and optimizes 
* the order of deliveries such that the time between successive deliveries is minimized, and 
* the shortest route between the already optimized delivery points
all with Simulated Annealing
